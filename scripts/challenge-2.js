/*
 Challenge 2: Print a table containing multiplication tables
    
   Let's start with the tables that many of us had to memorize in school. Can
	you print a table that contains all the answers to the multiplication
	tables from 1 through 10?

   Like Challenge #1, can you create an efficient solution that you could
	easily expand should you need the 12 times table?

// you can log out to the console or to the output container like this:
// output.innerText = "My output";
const output = document.getElementById("output-container");
if (!output) throw "Output container not found.";

//@ts-check
// your code starts after this line
